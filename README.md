## Overview

Welcome to the Machine Learning with Beauty project! This notebook introduces you to machine learning using real-world data from Sephora. You'll analyze and model data from over 8,000 skincare products and 1 million user reviews.

## Dataset

This dataset, collected in March 2023, includes:

- **Products**: Information on over 8,000 skincare products, including brand names, prices, ingredients, ratings, and features.
- **User Reviews**: Around 1 million reviews on 2,000+ products, covering user appearances and review ratings.

## Notebook Structure

The notebook is designed to guide you through the following steps in a machine learning workflow:

1. **Data Preparation**:
    - **Replacing**: Handling missing values or irrelevant data.
    - **Encoding**: Converting categorical data into numerical formats.
    - **Data Splitting**: Dividing the data into training and testing sets.

2. **Model Training**:
    - **Training Models**: Building and training machine learning models using the prepared data.

Each section provides a clear example followed by an exercise for you to complete. These exercises are designed to be similar to the examples, encouraging you to learn by doing without needing to research all the commands.

## How to Use This Notebook

- **Copy the Notebook**: Save a copy to your Google Drive.
- **Follow Along**: Work through each example, then attempt the exercises to reinforce your understanding.
- **Run the Code**: Execute the code cells to see the results, and experiment with modifications to deepen your learning.

## Prerequisites

- Basic Python knowledge.
- Familiarity with data handling using pandas and machine learning with scikit-learn is helpful but not required.

## Next Steps

By the end of this notebook, you'll have a strong grasp of basic machine learning concepts and hands-on experience that will prepare you for more advanced projects.
